1. Call the BookingKoala API with my token to retrieve bookings
2. Format the bookings data
3. Create/update records using the Airtable API
4. when you do the fetch, only pull back data where "Industry" is equal to "Home Cleaning"
5.

Once you've retrieved the CSV, you'll need to format the data to match Airtable field type requirements.
E.g. date fields are ISO 8601, phone numbers as strings, etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: BookingKoala booking IDs are not static. The code will need to know whether or not a booking is
already exported to Airtable.

To handle this:

1. Pull the current Airtable bookings (at_records) & the latest BookingKoala bookings CSV
2. Compare AT records against BookingKoala CSV records and isolate any from BookingKoala that differ
(records_to_add). Records that match mean they're already in AT, so you can leave them alone

3. Compare the isolated CSV records (records_to_add) with at_records and move any with a BookingKoala
booking ID match to a records_to_update list.

This should return three lists:

records_to_delete (which are the remaining records from AT)
records_to_add
records_to_update

The 3 lists represent the changes that need to be made in Airtable to sync with BookingKoala.

records_to_delete -> Delete Records API
records_to_add -> Create Records API
records_to_update -> Update Records API

Once you send the records to the right endpoints, the Airtable is in sync!

After you've got these 3 main steps done, the code is ready to be deployed.
